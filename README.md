# REAP

The Robust and Efficient Assessment of drug Potency (REAP) is developed for convenient application of the robust dose-response estimation to real-world data analysis. It presents a straightforward analytic environment for robust estimation of dose-response curve and assessment of key statistics, including implementation of statistical comparisons and delivery of customized output for graphic presentation.

We have included the two datasets we used in the REAP manuscript to demonstrate the functionalities:
1. Example1_B_cell_lymphoma.csv: for the first example of B-cell lymphoma data
2. Example2_SARS_CoV2.csv: for the second example of SARS-CoV-2 data
